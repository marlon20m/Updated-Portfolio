# üèÜ Updated-Portfolio üèÜ

## Description 

This portfolio demonstrates the projects that I have achieved with the help of different coding languages and tools. They consist of FoodTrucksATX which is a dedicated food truck search engine that includes directions in different modes of transport and cuisine details ranging from price to rating to foodtype. Workday Scheduler is also featured and it a functional daily planner web application that uses local storage as its main feature to store data. The Weather Dashboard is featured as well and displays weather data from cities around the world using a dedicated weather api. All these projects are presented on my website https://marlon20m.github.io/Updated-Portfolio/ which is made purely in Materialize css and features links to all respective projects and my own social media sites plus personal information
